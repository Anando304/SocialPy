Ways to improve:
Make the CLI available via some type of web terminal so that users don't have to keep pulling for updates, it will be auto-updated.
So updating is a problem currently.

Concurrent users - Currently we add some delays to adjust when multiple users using but we don't have a load balancer or anything
to distribute the load. Maybe potentially using some type of load balancer with a scheduling algorithm like round-robin or 
Shortest Task first modification so that longer waiting tasks don't starve.


Potentially moving to a document oriented DB like fireStore since it has built-in querying logic that may be much faster rather
than the manual approach we have that may not be as optimized.
